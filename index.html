            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Hello! My name is Angel Lores, and I am a graduate student at
              Portland State University pursuing a Master's degree in Computer
              Science.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy working on Cloud Infrastucture, AI and Machine Learning,
              and building tools that make complex systems easier to understand
              and use.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Currently working at the Standard Insurance Company as an
              Artifical Intelligence Engineer Intern to improve the efficiency
              of Retrieval Augmented Generation algorithms.
            </li>
            <li>
              I am also pursuing a Cybersecurity Graduate Certificate alongside
              my Masters of Science in Computer Science degree at Portland State
              University. My expected graduation date is March 2026.
            </li>
            <li>
              In my free time I enjoy playing video games such as Elden Ring,
              Red Dead Redemption 2, and Baldur's Gate 3. I am also attempting
              to branch out into other hobbies such as hiking and cooking.

          Feels like there should be three projects here, but not sure what to
